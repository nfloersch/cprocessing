# WHAT IS THIS? #

The cprocessing project provides a C++ library that creates an environment for graphics applications that closely resembles that of the Processing system.

The project mission is to implement Processing's friendly graphics functions and interaction model in C++.

The cprocessing backend is built upon OpenGL and Glut, which provide the actual graphics rendering. Cprocessing is only implemented in Linux for now.

We hope that, much in the same spirit of the Processing project, cprocessing will appeal to people who want to easily program and interact with computer generated imagery, as well as provide reliable and fast drawing tools (written in C++, which is faster than Java). It is also meant to help teaching computer programming by making it possible to write compact code with rich visual semantics.


# WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS? #

You'll need to have _Glut_ (the opengl utility toolkit) installed in your machine, as well as a C++ compiler.

# HOW TO INSTALL IT? #

Check out the _Source_ page for more information on how to get a copy of cprocessing repository.
Just use the command _make_ at cprocessing's directory to get it compiled.

# HOW TO USE IT? #

There are a few example programs in the examples folder that you may try. You may also take a look at the project wiki for simple usage instructions.
